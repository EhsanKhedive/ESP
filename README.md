# Ecological Statistics in Practice

## Overview:

In this course, students will learn the who, what, when, and why of various basic statistical tools and packages in the R programming environment, with emphasis on techniques commonly used in ecological studies. Students will work on applying statistical packages using their own data or real example datasets, building code, and visualization of results. Students will learn how to select and optimize the statistical methods so that they can extract the maximum information from their data. Ecological datasets can usually be analyzed using several types of statistical methods. Learning to select a method that best answers research hypotheses is key to research. Students are encouraged to bring their own datasets or discuss their desired variables so that we can discuss the different statistical methods which suit their data.

 ## Course learning objectives: By the end of this course, students will be able to:
 
•	Determine the assumptions of different statistical methods.

•	Select suitable statistical methods based on the data at hand.

•	Determine the advantages and disadvantages of using specific statistical methods.

•	Use R packages in analyzing their data.
